## Step 0: create a 3d model

## Step 1: 3d printing

## Step 2: Preparing for painting.   
cut connectors

put inside in the box

and cover with tape

## Step 3: Primer/Painting  
if your 3d model is red color, than use grey primer first to avoid too many layers of white painting)

## Step 4: put LEDs strip inside (I used 60led/meter strip)

connect led strip
![leds](https://github.com/ArtiomBoo/Arduino_HexaLeaf/blob/master/images/20190506_071555.jpg)
connect led strip to connectors  
then I realised that with 5 pin connectors would be everything much easier and cleaner.  
with 3/4 pin connector you need to be more careful when you connect one hexagon to another.

## Step 5: checking if everything works
