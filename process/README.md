## Step 0: create a 3d model

## Step 1: 3d printing

## Step 2: Preparing for painting.   
cut connectors
![connectors1](https://github.com/ArtiomBoo/Arduino_HexaLeaf/blob/master/images/20190505_204603.jpg)
put inside in the box

and cover with tape

## Step 3: Primer/Painting  
if your 3d model is red color, than use grey primer first to avoid too many layers of white painting)

## Step 4: put LEDs strip inside (I used 60led/meter strip)
![leds](https://github.com/ArtiomBoo/Arduino_HexaLeaf/blob/master/images/20190506_071515.jpg)
connect led strip
![leds2](https://github.com/ArtiomBoo/Arduino_HexaLeaf/blob/master/images/20190506_071555.jpg)
connect led strip to connectors  
then I realised that with 5 pin connectors would be everything much easier and cleaner.  
with 3/4 pin connector you need to be more careful when you connect one hexagon to another.

## Step 5: checking if everything works

## Step 6: making top part

It is easier to scoring and snapping plexiglass, but since i wanted to save some space and I used saw.

## Step 7: setting all together 
glue top to the main part
![top](https://github.com/ArtiomBoo/Arduino_HexaLeaf/blob/master/images/20190617_122513.jpg)
cut the fiber vinyl
![top2](https://github.com/ArtiomBoo/Arduino_HexaLeaf/blob/master/images/20190617_122013.jpg)
apply it to the top

## Step 7: Arduino & Blynk
